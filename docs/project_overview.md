# Project Overview

## Introduction
Welcome to my Todo app project, "my-TODO" (Will eventually think of a better name) !

my-TODO is a personal project aimed at developing a simple yet powerful to-do app built in Python to help myself track future projects, and build up my skills and experience for my portfolio. As someone who needs efficiency and organisation, I recognized the need for a user-friendly tool that could improve task management and keep projects going.

With my-TODO, my main objective is to create an intuitive and feature-rich application that meets all the needs I have. my-TODO aims to be a versatile solution for anyone seeking a more organized approach to task management. 

In this project, I plan to implement essential features such as task creation, task prioritization, due date tracking, and task categorisation. Additionally, I'll explore future features as I think of them / need them.

I'm excited to embark on this journey of building my-TODO and look forward to sharing my progress with you as the project unfolds! (And also hopefully speed up my future projects
